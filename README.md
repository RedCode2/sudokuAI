This structure ensures that users can easily set up and run your SudokuAI project locally. Since `npm run dev` is the primary command for running the project in development mode, it’s perfectly fine to include it in the instructions. If you later decide to deploy the project (e.g., using GitHub Pages or another hosting service), you can add additional instructions for building and deploying the project.
